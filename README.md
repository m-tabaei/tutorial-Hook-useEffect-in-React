useState:

useState is a React hook that allows functional components to manage and update state. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: 
the current state value and a function to update that state.

The dependency array  is optional. It contains variables or values that, when changed, trigger the effect to run again. If the array is empty, the effect runs only once after the initial render.

In summary, useState helps manage and update component state, while useEffect is used for handling side effects in functional components. These hooks are essential for managing the state and lifecycle of React components effectively.
